    <p class="content"> I am a second year computer science M.S. student at Georgia Tech, advised by <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Prof. Devi Parikh</a>. I also work closely with <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Prof. Dhruv Batra</a>. Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I was working as a Research Assistant in the Computer Vision Machine Learning and Perception Lab (CVMLP) at Virginia Tech, advised by <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/">Prof. Devi Parikh</a> and <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/">Prof. Dhruv Batra</a>. The problems that I work on lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in developing AI systems that </p>

    <!-- can perceive and reason based on multimodal sensory information, are interpretable so that decisions or predictions made by such models or systems can be explained as opposed to them being black-boxes and are transferable and robust in the sense that they can be adapted across different domains and problem settings with ease and limited supervision. -->

    <!-- My research interests focus on Semantic Scene Understanding and Artificial Intelligence. I am also interested in the interpretability aspect of Deep Learning models. </p> -->
    <p class="content">Previously, I have worked with <a href="http://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~mkrishna/">Dr. K. Madhava Krishna</a> on problems relating to Robot Vision and Navigation at Robotics Research Lab, IIIT Hyderabad. My interest in robotics stemmed from being a part of Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Team in my undergrad days. I specifically worked on Underwater Acoustics and Control System problems relating to the bot.</p>

    <p class="content">I also find Theoretical Physics to be fascinating. Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work with <a href="http://mailweb.iacs.res.in/theoph/tpssg/">Dr. Soumitra Sengupta</a> on f(R) gravity. Our quasi-static journey towards a unified theory, joining Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, is definitely a rewarding one. My interest in this specific branch of physics originated from trying to study Differential Geometry in my early undergrad days.</p> 

    <p class="content">I occasionally play the percussion instrument Tabla. I am very passionate about movies. I love to break them down shot-by-shot and analyze them. Every single frame is important.</p>
