    <p class="content"> I did my Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering, Amity University, advised by Dr. Rinki Gupta</a>. Simultaneously, I have worked as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Biomedical Image and Signal Processing Lab  at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, advised by <a href="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~amehndiratta/">Dr. Amit Mehndiratta</a>. Specifically, I am interested in developing medical imaging algorithms that </p>

      <li>can <b><i>Segment</i></b> based on different imaging modalities with the applications in medical fields based on prior geometries.</li>
      <li>are <b><i>interpretable</i></b> so that they are translatable with different imaging softwares. In fact, these algorithms are robust, computationally effective</li>
      <li>are <b><i>transferable</i></b> so that they can be adapted across different domains with ease and limited supervision</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p class="content"> My research interests focus on developing Deep Graph based algorithms for processing </b> medical images from different modalities. </p>
    <p class="content"> In addition to this, I had closely with <a href="https://www.tamuk.edu/engineering/departments/eecs/faculty-and-staff/ayush-goyal.html">Dr. Ayush Goyal</a>. My interest in Biomedical Imaging initiated at the start of my  second year as an undergraduate. I had specifically worked on Macula(Optical) localization problems and grading of disease(DR) during my second year. </p>
    <p class="content">Not only this, Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UZYa1C0AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Malay Kishore Dutta</a> on Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) problems. </p> 

    <p class="content"> During my summer research internship I got a prestigious opportunity to work at the lab, directed by <a href="https://www.engr.ucr.edu/people">Dr. Xiaoping P. Hu</a> at the University of California, Riverside. Here, during this time duration, I have worked on the segmentation of Substantia Nigra from the neuromelanin images.
    </p> I also had been selected for the research position at Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging<a href=" https://www.martinos.org/">, Cambridge, MA, USA, which was really a great opportunity.
