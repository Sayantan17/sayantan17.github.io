    <p class="content"> I am a third year Electronics and Communication Engineering UG student at Amity University, advised by <a href="https://http://auup.amity.edu/faculty-detail.aspx?facultyID=9578">Prof. Partha Sarathi Mangipudi</a>. I also work closely with <a href="http://auup.amity.edu/faculty-detail.aspx?facultyID=11724">Prof. Anupama Bhan</a>. Simultaneously I am working as a Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Biomedical Image and Signal Processing Lab  at IIT Delhi, advised by <a href="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~amehndiratta/">Prof. Amit Mehndiratta</a>. I work on the problems that lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Processing. Specifically, I am interested in developing medical imaging algorithms that </p>

      <li>can <b><i>Segment and Register</i></b> based on different algorithms including Segmentation and Registation which can be applied on different datasets.</li>
      <li>are <b><i>interpretable</i></b> so that accurate detection can  made by such algorithms can be beneficial to doctors</li>
      <li>are <b><i>transferable</i></b> so that they can be adapted across different domains with ease and limited supervision</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- can perceive and reason based on multimodal sensory information, are interpretable so that decisions or predictions made by such models or systems can be explained as opposed to them being black-boxes and are transferable and robust in the sense that they can be adapted across different domains and problem settings with ease and limited supervision. -->
    <!-- </p> -->
    <!-- My research interests focus onBiomedical Imaging (MRI and FMRI), Image Processing, Image Segmentation and Registration, Neuro Imaging and Applications. I am also interested in the interpretability aspect of Deep Learning models. </p> -->
    <p class="content">Previously, I am also working with <a href="http://www.tamuk.edu/engineering/departments/eecs/faculty_staff/Goyal.html">Dr. Ayush Goyal</a> on problems relating to Segmentation Based problems and their tecture analysis. My interest in robotics stemmed from being a second year undergraduate project. I specifically worked on Macula(Optical) localization problems and grading of disease(DR).</p>
    <p class="content">I also find Optical imaging to be fascinating. Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UZYa1C0AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Malay Kishore Dutta</a> on Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) problems. </p> 

    <p class="content">I am very passionate about developing new approaches that can help in Segmentation. I love to break them down shot-by-shot the medical problems and analyze them. Each application is important.</p>
