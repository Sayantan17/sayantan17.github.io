    <p class="content"> I am a final year Electronics and Communication Engineering UG student at Amity University, advised by Ms. Anupama Bhan and Dr. Rinki Gupta</a>. Simultaneously, I am working as a Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Biomedical Image and Signal Processing Lab  at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, advised by <a href="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~amehndiratta/">Prof. Amit Mehndiratta</a>. I work on the problems that lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Medical Image Processing. Specifically, I am interested in developing medical imaging algorithms that </p>

    <ul>
      <li>can <b><i>Segment and Register</i></b> based on different Magnetic Resonance(MR) imaging data with the applications in medical fields. I love to create the algorithms</li>
      <li>are <b><i>interpretable</i></b> so that accurate detection can  be done which can prove to be beneficial to doctors. In fact these algorithms are robust, computationally effective</li>
      <li>are <b><i>transferable</i></b> so that they can be adapted across different domains with ease and limited supervision</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <!-- </p> -->
    <p class="content"> My research interests focus on Deep Learning, Medical Image Processing with the applications in  neurology as well cardiology. I am also interested in the interpretability especially in medical aspect of Deep Learning models. </p>
    <p class="content"> In addition to this, I am also working closely with <a href="http://www.tamuk.edu/engineering/departments/eecs/faculty_staff/Goyal.html">Dr. Ayush Goyal</a> on problems relating to Segmentation Based problems and their tecture analysis. My interest in Biomedical Imaging initiated at the start of my  second year as an undergraduate. I had specifically worked on Macula(Optical) localization problems and grading of disease(DR) during my second year. </p>
    <p class="content">I used to find Optical imaging to be fascinating at initial stages. Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work with <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=UZYa1C0AAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Malay Kishore Dutta</a> on Diabetic Retinopathy(DR) problems. </p> 

    <p class="content">As a result, I am very passionate about developing new approaches and ubiquitous solutions that can help in analyzing the medical images. During my summer research internship I got a prestigious opportunity to work at the lab, directed by <"https://www.engr.ucr.edu/people">Dr. Xiaoping P. Hu at the University of California, Riverside. Here, during this time duration, I have worked on the segmentation of Substantia Nigra from the neuromelanin images. This research experience focused around the idea that the substantia nigra undergoes neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease and my target was to improve how substantia nigra is segmented in a computationally effective approach. So, my contribution to this research project went very well and I was able to achieve my task with a fair amount of accuracy. 
Each application is important.</p>
